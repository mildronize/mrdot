# Mr.Dot
I'm Dot. I can manage a lot of your dotfiles.

## I am a baby. Please don't use me now.

I collect some starter tools for dotfiles.

- ( Zsh + Oh-my-zsh ) by Zgen
- Vim + VimPlug
- TMUX + TPM

```
.mrdot    : create rc file to $HOME
.dotfiles : your custom dotfiles in git repo
```

## install
```
curl http://blabla  -L -o - | sh
```

## Usage
- `mrdot add .vimrc` means add local `.vimrc` into the system
- `mrdot list` means show all local configs which you added
